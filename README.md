# Ruby on rails blog
This project was my first expierence with both Ruby and Rails.  The goal was to create a simple blogging website that would include:

 - User accounts
 - Ability for users to create posts and comments
	 - Posts and comments should have CRUD capabilities implemented
	 - Users should only be able to edit/delete their own posts and comments

### Versions
 - Ruby 2.7.2
 - Rails 6.0.3.4
